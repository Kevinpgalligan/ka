# ka(lculator) ðŸ–©
ka is a small calculator language. It supports various useful features for day-to-day calculations, including common math functions, fractions, units, and unit conversion.

There are three ways to interface with it: direct CLI commands (`ka '1+1'`), a CLI interpreter (`ka`), and a GUI (`ka --gui`).

## TODO
* Write manual for GitHub:
    - Description & features
    - Installation
    - Units (list of units, unit behaviour, unit arithmetic)
    - Functions & operators
* Fix once-off commands starting with '-'.
* Simple GUI.

## Installation
ka is currently distributed through PyPI (insert link here): `pip3 install ka-cli`.

If a kind person could help me to package it for the various Linux distributions, I would greatly appreciate it.

## Usage
To run a once-off command, surround the blah you want to execute in single quotes so that it's note interpreted as an argument to the CLI:

```
$ ka '1+1'
2
```

To start the interpreter, execute `ka` with no arguments:

```
$ ka
ka version 1.0
>>> 1+1
0
>>>
```

To start the GUI, run `ka --gui`.

Here's some of the stuff you can do.

```
>>> sin(90 deg)
1 
>>> 2 * (1/2)
1
>>> 1m + 1ft
1.3048 m
>>> 5 metres > feet
16.404199475065617
>>> 5! + C(4,3)
124
>>> quit()
$
```

## FAQ
#### How do you exit the interpreter?
Call the function `quit()`, use the interpreter command `%q` / `%quit`, or trigger an interrupt with CTRL+C.

#### Why does `5/4 m` give units in `m^-1`?
Units have higher precedence than division in the parsing, so `5/4 m` is parsed the same as `5 / (4 m)`. The solution is to write `(5/4)m`.

#### How does this compare to other calculator languages?

## Manual
### Types
ka is strongly typed, not statically typed. What this means is that when you pass a fractional number to a function that expects an integer, the type system will complain. But you don't have to declare the type of anything in advance.

The type system consists of (1) a hierarchy of numerical types, and (2) quantities.

The hierarchy of numerical types goes: Number > Real > Rational/Fraction > Integral/Integer. 'Real' numbers are represented as floating point numbers. If a fraction can be simplified to an integer, such as 2/2, then this will happen automatically. In the other direction, a type that is lower down the hierarchy, such as an integer, can be cast into a type that's further up the hierarchy in order to match a function signature.

Quantities consist of two components: a magnitude and a unit (see below). Any quantities can be multiplied together or divided into each other, but only quantities of the same type can be added or subtracted. This is enforced by the binary operators themselves (addition and subtraction) rather than any type-checking built into the language.

Most functions can be applied to both Numbers and Quantities.

### Functions
4 types of functions: regular, binary operators, prefix operators, postfix operators.

| Name | Signatures |
| --- | --- |
| ! | (Integral) |
| % | (Number, Number) |
| * | (Number, Number)<br/>(Quantity, Quantity)<br/>(Number, Quantity)<br/>(Quantity, Number) |
| + | (Number, Number)<br/>(Number)<br/>(Quantity)<br/>(Quantity, Quantity)<br/>(Number, Quantity)<br/>(Quantity, Number) |
| - | (Number, Number)<br/>(Number)<br/>(Quantity)<br/>(Quantity, Quantity)<br/>(Number, Quantity)<br/>(Quantity, Number) |
| / | (Number, Number)<br/>(Integral, Integral)<br/>(Quantity, Quantity)<br/>(Number, Quantity)<br/>(Quantity, Number) |
| C | (Integral, Integral) |
| ^ | (Number, Number) |
| abs | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| ceil | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| cos | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| float | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| floor | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| int | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| ln | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| log | (Number, Number) |
| log10 | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| log2 | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| round | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| sin | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| sqrt | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |
| tan | (Number)<br/>(Quantity) |

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, whether they be bug fixes or documentation or whatever! Note that I don't intend to make any major additions to the core language, since for the purposes of a calculator it's reasonably complete. That means I don't plan to make it Turing-complete.

To install ka locally, clone the repo and run `pip install .`. You may wish to test it within a virtual environment, however, if you have a copy of ka that you actually use and you don't want to break it.

[tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) is used for unit testing, execute `tox` from the base directory to run all unit tests.
